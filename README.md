## 🧠 NeuroEco: Unified disaster predictive Intelligence Hub (Ideathon Prototype)

**Project Type:** High-Fidelity Ideathon Concept & UI/UX Showcase

**[VIEW FIGMA DESIGN 🔗](https://www.figma.com/make/9zqvF7DGfwp2w2SDRpn2r3/NeuroEco-Unified-Intelligence-Hub?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=GVyt32jj4cWQJcWo-0&fullscreen=1)**

NeuroEco is a concept prototype developed for an **Ideathon**, showcasing a high-fidelity interface for integrating **cognitive health metrics with environmental data**. Its primary goal was to clearly and compellingly demonstrate a complex idea through visually stunning design and highly interactive mock components.

### 🌟 Key Design & Conceptual Highlights

* **High-Fidelity Interaction:** Built with fully interactive components and cards that utilize **functional mock data** to simulate real-time cognitive and environmental inputs.
* **Complex Concept Simplified:** Successfully translates a multi-faceted idea (Neuro-Cognitive Health and Ecological Impact) into an **intuitive and engaging dashboard** experience.
* **Visual Communication:** The design excels at **visual storytelling**, using clear analytics, charting, and structured cards to articulate the project's vision, making it highly effective for presentations and pitching.
* **Ideathon Success:** The prototype confirmed the conceptual viability of the product, demonstrating strong skills in **conceptualization, design execution, and visual communication.**

### ⚙️ Technical Structure

* **Implementation:** This is a frontend-only prototype built to showcase the design logic.
* **Data Integration Simulation:** Achieved through the strategic use of mock data to confirm component rendering and data flow readiness.
